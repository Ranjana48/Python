'''Paycheck Calculation
Scenario:
You are building a payroll system. The program needs to calculate the total salary based on hourly wages and the number of hours worked, with overtime calculations:

Regular hourly wage: $15/hr.

Overtime wage: $22.5/hr (for hours worked beyond 40 hours in a week).

Exercise:
Write a Python program that calculates the total paycheck, factoring in regular hours and overtime.

Example Input:
hours_worked = 45, hourly_rate = 15

Expected Output:
Total Pay: $712.5'''
